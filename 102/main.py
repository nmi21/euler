"""
Three distinct points are plotted at random on a Cartesian plane, for which -1000 â‰¤ x, y â‰¤ 1000, such that a triangle
is formed.

Consider the following two triangles:

A(-340,495), B(-153,-910), C(835,-947)

X(-175,41), Y(-421,-714), Z(574,-645)

It can be verified that triangle ABC contains the origin, whereas triangle XYZ does not.

Using triangles.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 27K text file containing the co-ordinates of one
thousand "random" triangles, find the number of triangles for which the interior contains the origin.

NOTE: The first two examples in the file represent the triangles in the example given above.


---
Method:
- a method to determine if a point lies within the region of the triangle is to add the point in question (the origin)
to a set of points formed by the triangle. From there, determine the convex hull of the system.
    - if the hull has three points, then the point is within the triangle
    - if the hull has four points, then the point is outside of the triangle

- form the triangle with a vertices A, B, and C
    - let AB and AC be the vectors between A and the other two vertices
    - you can then give directions to the origin in terms of the vertex A and the two vectors AB and AC as follows:
        - origin = A + a*AB + b*AC
        where x and y are constants
    - solve for a and b to get:
        a = det(origin -- AC) - det(A -- AC) / det(AB -- AC)
        b = - (det(origin -- AB) - det(origin -- AB) / det(AB -- AC)

    where det(u -- v) == u x v == u_x * v_y - u_y * v_x
