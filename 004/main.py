"""
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is
9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

---

Method:
- largest composite number from 2 3-digit numbers is 999*999
- smallest is 100*100
- search space is small enough that can search over entire space
