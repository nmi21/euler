"""
If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions
for p = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

- we know that p = a + b + c
- we also know that, since it is a right triangle, a^2 + b^2 = c^2

Strategy
- iterate from p = 1 to p = 1000
- start with a = 1, b = 1
- calculate c = p - a - b
- determine if right triangle via pythagorean theorem
- if yes, add to counter
- if no, next iteration
